## Partical simulation


• determine the center of mass of each cell __(Diogo)__  
• compute the gravitational force applied to each particle __(Carlos)__  
• calculate the new velocity and then the new position of each particle __(Beatriz)__

## Run

1) To compile and create the executable of the program type:  
    `$ make`  
    
2) To run type `$ ./simpar a b c d`  
    where:
            a = seed for the random number generator  
            b = size of the grid (number of cells on the side)  
            c = number of particles  
            d = number of time-steps  

3) To clean the files created type the command "make clean" in the terminal.
